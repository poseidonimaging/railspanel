== Welcome to RailsPanel

RailsPanel is a control panel application that lets you change some stuff on
your server. It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 2.0.

== Current RailsPanel Features

* BIND-DLZ (BIND Dynamically Loaded Zones) support. Add domains and such in
  the BIND-DLZ database (note: MySQL is expected, but it might work with other
  DBMSes).

== Installation

1. Install your distribution's Ruby on Rails package (e.g. `emerge rails`), or
   use `gem install rails`. Of course, we already assume you have Ruby and the
   associated libraries and such installed.
2. Decide how you'll run this application. There are lots of ways to do it:
   a. Run it in development mode: `ruby script/server`
   b. Run it under Mongrel: `mongrel_rails start`
   c. Run it with Apache and FastCGI (Google it to figure out how).
   d. Find another way to do it under CGI.
3. Change the database configuration so that it points at your database with
   your username and such. See config/database.yml.
4. Run `rake db:migrate` to set up the database.
5. Start the application (see step 2).
6. Open up your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ (if in development)
   or http://localhost/ (if in production), replacing localhost with the right
   hostname. Also specify the path and such if needed. I don't know how you
   configured it.
7. You're done!

== BIND DLZ Configuration

We have slightly modified the "default" BIND DLZ schema so that it is less
wasteful of database resources, and so it makes more sense in models. 

TODO: Put a working BIND DLZ configuration here
